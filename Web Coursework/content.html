    <p>Football has a long and illustrious history. Football as we know it now began in England in the mid-nineteenth century. Alternative variants of the game, on the other hand, existed far earlier and are documented in football history.<br>Football, commonly known as association football or soccer, is a sport in which two teams of 11 players attempt to move the ball into the other team's goal using any part of their body except the hands and arms. Only the goalie is allowed to touch the ball, and only within the penalty area that surrounds the goal. The squad that scores the most goals is the winner. Football is the most popular sport in the world in terms of both participation and spectators. The sport can be played practically everywhere, from official football playing fields (pitches) to streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches, thanks to its basic rules and equipment. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) estimated that there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people "interested" in football at the turn of the twenty-first century; in 2010, a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football's premier tournament, the World Cup finals.</p>
